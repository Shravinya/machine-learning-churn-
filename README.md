## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [provide source or link if applicable]. It contains information about customers, including demographic data and subscription details, along with a target variable indicating churn.

## Features
The key features of the dataset include:
- `customerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `gender`: Gender of the customer.
- `SeniorCitizen`: Indicates if the customer is a senior citizen.
- `Partner`: Indicates if the customer has a partner.
- `Dependents`: Indicates if the customer has dependents.
- `tenure`: The number of months the customer has been with the service.
- `MonthlyCharges`: The amount charged to the customer monthly.
- `TotalCharges`: The total amount charged to the customer.
- `Churn`: Target variable indicating if the customer has churned.

## Implementation
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load the dataset, clean the data, and perform exploratory data analysis to understand customer behaviors.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features for modeling.
3. **Model Selection**: Utilize machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest for predicting customer churn.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy percentage] on the test dataset, indicating its effectiveness in predicting customer churn. Feature importance analysis revealed that factors like `tenure` and `MonthlyCharges` are significant predictors of churn.

## Conclusion
This AI-powered customer churn prediction system offers valuable insights into customer retention strategies in the fintech sector. By leveraging machine learning, businesses can proactively address churn risks and enhance customer satisfaction.
